## Installing

FreeCAD uses the [LGPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License) license, which makes 
you free to download, install, redistribute and use FreeCAD the way you want, regardless of the type of work 
you'll do with it (commercial or non-commercial). You are not bound to any clause or restriction, and the files
you produce with it are fully yours. The only thing that the license prohibits, really, is to claim that you 
programmed FreeCAD yourself!

FreeCAD runs without any difference on Windows, Mac OS and Linux. However, the ways to install it differ slightly
depending on your platform: On Windows and Mac, the FreeCAD community provides precompiled packages
(installers) ready to download, while on Linux, the source code is made available to Linux distributions
maintainers, who are then responsible for packaging FreeCAD for their specific distribution. As a result,
on Linux, you can usually install FreeCAD right from the software manager application.

The official FreeCAD download page fro Windows and Mac OS is https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/releases

**FreeCAD versions**

The official releases of FreeCAD, that you can find on the page above and in your distribution's software
manager, are stable versions. However, the development of FreeCAD is fast! New features and bug fixes
are added almost every single day. Since it can sometimes take a long time between stable releases, you might
be interested in trying a more bleeding-edge version of FreeCAD. These development versions, or pre-releases,
are uploaded from time to time on the download page above, or, if you are using Ubuntu, the FreeCAD community
also maintains a PPA at https://launchpad.net/~freecad-maintainers/+archive/ubuntu/freecad-daily which is 
regularly updated with the most recent changes.

### Installing on Windows

1. Download an installer (.exe) package corresponding to your version of Windows (32bit or 64bit) from  https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/releases. The FreeCAD installers should work on any windows version.
2. Double-click the downloaded installer.
3. Accept the terms of the LGPL license (this will be one of the few cases where you can really, safely click the "accept" button without reading the text. No hidden clauses):

4. You can leave the default path here, or change if you wish:

5. No need to set the PYTHONPATH variable, unless you plan to do some advanced python programming, in which case you probably already know what this is for:

6. During the installation, a couple of additional components, which are bundled inside the installer, will be installed too:

7. That's it, FreeCAD is installed. You will find it in your start menu.
