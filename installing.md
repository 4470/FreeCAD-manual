## Installing

FreeCAD uses the [LGPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License) license, which makes 
you free to download, install, redistribute and use FreeCAD the way you want, regardless of the type of work 
you'll do with it (commercial or non-commercial). You are not bound to any clause or restriction, and the files
you produce with it are fully yours. The only thing that the license prohibits, really, is to claim that you 
programmed FreeCAD yourself!

FreeCAD runs without any difference on Windows, Mac OS and Linux. However, the ways to install it differ slightly
depending on your platform: On Windows and Mac, the FreeCAD community provides precompiled packages
(installers) ready to download, while on Linux, the source code is made available to Linux distributions
maintainers, who are then responsible for packaging FreeCAD for their specific distribution. As a result,
on Linux, you can usually install FreeCAD right from the software manager application.

The official FreeCAD download page fro Windows and Mac OS is https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/releases

**FreeCAD versions**

The official releases of FreeCAD, that you can find on the page above and in your distribution's software
manager, are stable versions. However, the development of FreeCAD is fast! New features and bug fixes
are added almost every single day. Since it can sometimes take a long time between stable releases, you might
be interested in trying a more bleeding-edge version of FreeCAD. These development versions, or pre-releases,
are uploaded from time to time on the download page above, or, if you are using Ubuntu, the FreeCAD community
also maintains a PPA at https://launchpad.net/~freecad-maintainers/+archive/ubuntu/freecad-daily which is 
regularly updated with the most recent changes.
