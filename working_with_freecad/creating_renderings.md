## Creating renderings

In computer talk, a [rendering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_%28computer_graphics%29) is a word used to describe a nice image produced from a 3D model. Of course, we could say that what se see in the FreeCAD 3D view is already nice. But anybody who saw a recent Hollywood movie knows that it is possible to produce images with a computer that are almost undistinguishable from a photograph.

Of course, producing such photo-realistic images requires a lot of work, and a 3D application that offers specific tools for that, such as precise controls for materials and lighting. FreeCAD being an application more geared towards technical modeling, it doesn't feature any advanced rendering tool.

Fortunately, the opens-source world offers many applications to produce realistic images. Probably the most famous one is [Blender](http://www.blender.org), which is very popular and widely used in the movies and gaming industries. 3D models can very easily and faithfully be exported from FreeCAD and imported into Blender, where you can add realistic materials and illumination, and produce the final images or even animations.

Some other open-source rendering tools are made to be used inside another application, and will take care of doing the complex calculations to  produce realistic images. Through its [Raytracing Workbench](http://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Raytracing_Module), FreeCAD can use two of these rendering tools: [POV-Ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POV-Ray) and [Luxrender](http://www.luxrender.net).
