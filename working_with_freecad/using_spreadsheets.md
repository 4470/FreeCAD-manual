## Using spreadsheets

FreeCAD features another interesting workbench to explore: the [Spreadsheet Workbench](http://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Spreadsheet_Module). This workbench allows to create [spreadsheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadsheet) such as those made with [Excel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel) or [LibreOffice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenOffice.org_Calc) directly in FreeCAD. These spreadsheets can then be populated with data extracted from your model, and can also perform a series of calculations between values. Spreadsheets can be exported as CSV files, which can be imported in any other spreadsheet application.

In FreeCAD, however, spreadsheets have an additional utility: Their cells can receive a name, and can then be referenced by any field supported by the [expressions engine](http://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Expressions). This turns spreadsheets into powerful control structures, where the values inserted in specific cells can drive dimensions of the model.
