## BIM modeling

BIM stands for [Building Information Modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_information_modeling). The exact definition of what it is varies, but we can say simply that is how buildings and other large structures like bridges, tunnels, etc... are modeled today. BIM models are usually based on 3D models, and also include a series of additional layers of information, such as materials information, relationships to other objects or models, or special instructions for building or maintenance. This extra information permits all kinds of advanced analyses of the model, such as structural resistance, cost and construction time estimations, or calculaitons of energy consumption.

The [Architecture Workbench](http://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Arch_Module) of FreeCAD implements a series of tools and facilities for BIM modeling. Although it has a different purpose, it is made to work in tight integration with the rest of FreeCAD: Anything made with any other workbench of FreeCAD can become an Arch object, or be used as a base for an Arch object.

As in the [PartDesign Workbench](http://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=PartDesign_Workbench), the objects produced by the Arch Workbench are meant to be built in the real world. Therefore, they need to be **solid**.
