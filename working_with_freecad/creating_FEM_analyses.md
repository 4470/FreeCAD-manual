## Creating FEM analyses

FEM stands for [Finite Element Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method). It is a vast mathematical subject, but in FreeCAD we can resume it as a way to calculate propagations inside a 3D object, by cutting it into small pieces, and analyzing the impact of each small piece over its neighbours. This has several uses in the engineering and electomagnetism fields, but we will look here more in depth at one use that is already well developed in FreeCAD, which is calculating deformations in objects which are submitted to forces and weights.
