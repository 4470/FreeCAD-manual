# A FreeCAD manual

An experiment at reorganizing the contents of the [FreeCAD wiki](http://www.freecadweb.org/wiki) in an easier, friendlier book-like manner, more based on examples. The contents of this manual is made from parts of the wiki, and parts of text directly written by me and hopefully through the power of git forking, others will contribute as well. All the contents of this manual are published under the [Creative Commons 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license, and can be freely used, downloaded, copied, and modified.

Start with the [table of contents](SUMMARY.md). 

If you are a book editor interested in publishing this book, drop me a note ;)

This book is being tailored to be used with [gitbook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook). A preview of the final book is available at https://www.gitbook.com/book/yorikvanhavre/a-freecad-manual/
