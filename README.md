# FreeCAD-manual

An experiment at reorganizing the contents of the [FreeCAD wiki](http://www.freecadweb.org/wiki) in an easier, friendlier book-like manner, more based on examples. The contents of this manual is made from parts of the wiki, and parts of text directly written by me. All the contents of this manual are published under the [Creative Commons 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license, and can be freely used, downloaded, copied, and modified.
