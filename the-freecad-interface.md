# The FreeCAD interface

FreeCAD uses the Qt framework to draw and manage its interface. This framework is used in a wide range of
applications, so the FreeCAD interface is very classical and presents no particular difficulty to understand.

The start center is a convenient "welcome screen", that shows useful information for newcomers, like the latest
files you have been working on, what's new in the FreeCAD world, or quick info about the most common
workbenches. It will also notify you if a new stable version of FreeCAD is available.

But after a while, or after you did some changes in the preferences, you will much more likely find yourself
directly in one of the other workbenches, with a new document open:
