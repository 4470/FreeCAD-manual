## The FreeCAD document

A FreeCAD document contains all the objects of your scene. It can contain groups, and objects made with any workbench. 
You can therefore switch between workbenches, and still work on the same document. The document is what gets saved to 
disk when you save your work. You can also open several documents at the same time in FreeCAD, and open several views 
of the same document.

Inside the document, the objects can be moved into groups, and have a unique name. Managing groups, objects and object 
names is done mainly from the Tree view. There, you can create groups, move objects to groups, delete objects or groups, by 
right-clicking in the tree view or on an object, rename objects, change their color, hide or show them, or possibly other 
operations, depending on the current workbench.

The objects inside a FreeCAD document can be of different types. Each workbench can add its own types of objects, for example the [Mesh Workbench](http://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Mesh_Module) adds mesh objects, the [Part Workbench](http://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part_Module) adds Part objects, etc.

If there is at least one document open in FreeCAD, there is always one and only one active document. That's the document that appears in the current 3D view, the document you are currently working on. If you switch tabs to another document, that one
becomes the active document. Most operations always work on the active document.
